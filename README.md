# HTTP Library with Fetch - Async

Easy HTTP Library with Fetch using async functions to consume external and internal APIs.

This library is one of the exercises developed in the course Modern JavaScript from the Beginning by Udemy/Brad Traversy.

The base to create this library was the HTTP Library with Fetch using Promises repository, which was cloned and the functions modified to async functions, that will always return a value. 

- Why use async functions?

"Using async simply implies that a promise will be returned, and if a promise is not returned, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved promise with its value."
